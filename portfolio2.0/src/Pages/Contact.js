// Will be a form with Name/Email/Message fields all required. When cursor is moved 
//out of the field the message pops up

// Needs to be a valid email address and say so if not

//The contact form should be similar to the one you built in the module project. 
// Because this application doesn’t include a back end or connect to an API, 
// you can set up this functionality the same way you did in the module project 
// and add in back-end functionality after you’ve covered it in the next few weeks.

// consider adding your email address and phone number on the Contact page.
